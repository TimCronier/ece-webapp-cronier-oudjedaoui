# Blogging application - ECE Webtech project

This project, created by Tom, consists in developing a digital application, implementing several features including these :
* Authenticate users using an external provider with OAuth2.
* Navigate through authenticated user articles and comments, and manage them.
* Comment on other user's articles.
* Edit and remove his articles and comments.
* Display the user profile and modify his settings.
* Use the user Gravatar if any or provide a default randomly generated Gravatar, choose an avatar proposed by the application, and upload his avatar.  

We decided to develop this project on the theme of Punchologue, a media dealing with French rap. This media is quite recent and is only present on social networks such as Instagram and YouTube.
